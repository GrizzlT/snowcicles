# Snowcicles - modular templates for Nix(OS)

This repo is my latest attempt at keeping my code
[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Instead of having
a bunch of different machine configurations around and sharing a lot of config
in each configuration once, I'll now use this repo for any common pieces of code
I use more than once. More readme will follow with updates.
